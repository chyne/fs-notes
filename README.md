# My Farming Simulator 22 Notes

## Productions

Most base game productions (but not all) are 'shared throughput' meaning that the maximum produced per product line is divided by the number of product lines running (e.g. if you've got two product lines running in a single facility, each line will produce half as much as if it was running alone).
